ssh-keygen This command is used to generate SSH key pairs for secure authentication.

$ ssh-keygen

To give the user access to the server via SSH using their public key, you can copy the public key to the authorized_keys file in the user's home directory. 
If the authorized_keys file doesn't exist, you can create it:

	# Create the .ssh directory if it doesn't exist

$ sudo mkdir -p /home//[user_name]/.ssh   
# Copy the public key to the authorized_keys file
$ sudo cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub /home/[user_name]/.ssh/authorized_keys   
# Set ownership and permissions
$ sudo chown -R [user_name]: [user_name] /home/[user_name]/.ssh   
$ sudo chmod 700 /home/[user_name]/.ssh
$ sudo chmod 600 /home/[user_name]/.ssh/authorized_keys
